      <img id="selfimg" alt="my photo" src="images/self.jpg">
      <p class="about-me-text">Well, first off my name is Dominique, and I
        currently live in San Fransisco, CA.  My life has been up and down the
        past few years, from having a fairly lucrative job, to moving to China
        and teaching young learners how to speak English.  I am a 26 year old
        who has spent most of his life studying and working away.  I have always
        had a strong interest in computers, I even how to build my own desktop
        when i was sixteen years old. </p>
        <p class="about-me-text">Until recently i just thought of it as a hobby and a way
        to pass time, however since moving to San Fransisco, I've realised that
        i can make this "hobby" become something i look forward to doing every
        day at work!  I became motivated and joined Udacity to do just that!  I
        have high expectations for my sucess, and strive to use my experiences
        inside and outside of the technology world to push myself and those
        around me.</p>
